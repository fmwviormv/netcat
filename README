NETEXEC

Execute command by TCP/Unix connection.


HOW TO BUILD

You need C build tools (make and gcc/clang).
Then run:

	$ make


EXAMPLE 1

Run shell by Unix connection (NOTE: this example is dangerous):

	$ ./netexec /tmp/sh.sock -- /bin/sh

Now you can run shell commands from other terminals:

	$ nc -U /tmp/sh.sock
	ls
	Makefile
	README
	netexec
	netexec.c

EXAMPLE 2

Forward local connections to TOR using netcat:

	$ ./netexec 127.0.0.1 8080 -- nc -x127.0.0.1:9050 openbsd.org 80

And in an another terminal:

	$ curl 127.0.0.1:8080
